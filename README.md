# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-OpenC

The Program is written using OpenCV.
The main objective of this code is self explanatory - To detect whether the driver is sleeping and to wake him up.

The program does exactly that by running facial recoginition on the driver and checks whether the eyes are closed for a 
significant amount of time. If they are, then it sounds a shrill beep to wake the driver up.

Moreover, there is an additional feature that tracks the driver's mouth to see if he/she is yawning and alerts him/her
with a different beep to warn the driver that he/she may be drowsy.
